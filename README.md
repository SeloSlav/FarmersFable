# FarmersFable

In order to make changes to Farmer's Fable...

The project must first be exported as an "HTML5 Project" from Construct 2. The Construct 2 project file is not included in this repository. This should be kept offline to avoid cluttering the repository. It can be provided upon request.

All the files in the folder generated thereafter should be copied to the local FarmersFable repository, **EXCEPT** the generated index.html file. If the generated index.html file is included, it will override the layout, including navigation bar, sound controls, etc., which we do not want.

In order to deploy changes, push local changes to the git repository. The changes will be reflected at https://seloslav.github.io/FarmersFable/ after 60 seconds.

In order to host this project on other domains, simply move the entire contents of this repository to the root directory of your custom domain.
